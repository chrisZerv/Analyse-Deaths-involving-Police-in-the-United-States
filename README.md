# Police Killings Data Analysis

This project is inspired by [The Washington Post’s Police Shootings Database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/), which documents every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since January 1, 2015. The project analyzes this data to identify trends, examine the impact of factors such as race and mental illness, and explore the relationship between police killings and socio-economic variables like poverty.

## Background
This project analyzes the police killings data to identify patterns and correlations related to race, mental illness, poverty, and other socio-economic factors. It was inspired by the Washington Post’s effort to make police killings data more transparent to the public, helping us understand social trends and systemic issues.

The project is structured to answer questions like:
- Which U.S. cities and states see the highest number of police killings?
- What are the racial demographics of people killed by police?
- Is there a correlation between poverty rates and police killings?
- How many people killed by police had been diagnosed with a mental illness?

## Data Sources
This project uses the following datasets:
1. **Police Killings Data** (from The Washington Post):
   - A database that records every fatal shooting by a police officer in the line of duty.
   - Columns include the victim's age, race, gender, whether they were armed, signs of mental illness, and more.
2. **U.S. Census Data**:
   - Datasets that provide state-wise socio-economic indicators such as:
     - Poverty rates
     - Median household income
     - High school graduation rates
     - Racial demographics of cities and states

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze police killings across various dimensions like race, mental illness, and armed status.
2. Visualize police killings geographically (by state and city) using a choropleth map.
3. Investigate the relationship between police killings and socio-economic factors like poverty, education, and income.
4. Provide insights into the racial disparities in police killings and identify trends over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive charts and maps.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and running the analysis.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
